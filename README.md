TSW2_Controller allows you to control TSW2 with your joystick. It reads your screen to get the current state of the simulator and synchronize it to your joystick. That way, they don't end up having mismatching positions.

I was bothered by the fact that you can't use a joystick as an input device in TSW2, so I wrote my own program to solve the problem. Since I was quite happy with the result, I thought why not publish the program so that others can use it as well.  And now here we are
## Features

- Translate movement from joystick to game
- You are able to use multiple joysticks
- Reads screen to match joystick to game
- Supports custom button mapping
- You can add trains yourself
- Supports English and German
- Auto updater
## Important!

I have included a lot of trains, but configured them to match my "thrustmaster t flight hotas x" and the German language

**If you are using a different joystick, or are using a different language, you have to edit the controllers!**

If you want to know how to do that, look into the `Tutorials` folder
## Installation

Just download the `TSW2_Controller_Setup.exe` file under `Releases` and run the setup.

If you don't want to run the exe file, you can download `TSW2_Controller.zip`

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

If you want to contribute to this project, just create a branch and if you are finished, create a pull request into the `develop` branch.

The code doesn't really look that nice since I only do programming as a hobby, but that shouldn't bother too much.

Please let me know if there are any spelling mistakes or anything like that.
